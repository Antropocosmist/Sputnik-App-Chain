# Information for validators

Dear validators of the Sputnik Network App-chain!

We are currently at the dev-net stage of the PostState Blockchain, and before its launch we need to prepare all the necessary infrastructure

The Sputnik Network App-chain will be one of the components of the future PostState Blockchain, but at the same time it will perform independent functionality

In the near future we will launch the Sputnik Network test-net, and we will notify you about it again

Before launching the test-net, we want to bring you up to date:

1. Sputnik Network App-chain is a Cosmos SDK based blockchain.

Launching blockchains on Cosmos SDK is a standard procedure for you

All the launch documentation has long been familiar to you, but even despite this, we will soon publish all the necessary information for launch

2. In addition to launching a standard blockchain on Cosmos SDK, we will need you to take a snapshot of your delegators in all Cosmos Ecosystem networks that you validate 

The main coin of the Sputnik Network App-chain - $SIGNAL - will be distributed with a stakedrop

All delegators of the Cosmos Ecosystem networks, as well as users of Sputnik Network Bot, will be eligible for $SIGNAL-stakedrop

In addition, all delegators of those validators who will validate the Sputnik Network App-chain will receive a stakedrop with a multiplier of 2

The first snapshot will need to be taken before the launch of the test-net, and we will inform you about this in advance in order to enter all the necessary data into the testnet genesis file

As always, CEX-validators, fundation validators, and validators with a 0%-commission will be excluded from the stakedrop

Delegators of validators with 0%-commission who will validate the Sputnik Network App-chain will be eligible for $SIGNAL-stakedrop, but only with a multiplier of 1

3. After testing of the Sputnik Network App-chain is completed, all validators who took part will receive a delegation in the Sputnik Network main-net with vesting for 1 year (full tokenomics will be published soon)

Validators who make a contribution to the development of the Sputnik Network App-chain during the test-net will receive additional delegations

The list of contributions has already been known to you for a long time, but it will also be published closer to the launch of the test-net

4. In order to avoid the influx of "test-net airdrop hunters", test-net will officially be declared "not incentivized"

But despite this, you should know that every validator who makes a contribution to the testing and development of the Sputnik Network App-chain will receive a reward both for themselves and for their delegators.

5. Since Sputnik Network is an App-chain for implementing the web3-functionality of Sputnik Network Bot, we do not need to chase the number of validators

First of all, we will be interested in the quality of validators!

For the beginning, we ask you to create a pull request in https://github.com/PostState/Sputnik-App-Chain repo to add your validator to the list of test-net validators
- Pull request name: Add <Your_moniker>
- In the body of pull request, we ask you to provide all links to your validators in the Cosmos Ecosystem main-nets, or a link to a file where we can see a complete list of your validators in the Cosmos Ecosystem main-nets
- We also ask you to indicate a contact for quick communication, for example your Telegram username

An example of such a pull request: [https://github.com/PostState/Sputnik-App-Chain/pull/1](https://github.com/PostState/Sputnik-App-Chain/blob/main/Add%20POSTHUMAN)
